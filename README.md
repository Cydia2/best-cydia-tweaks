## 27. Checkl0ck Tweak

Checkl0ck is a powerful jailbreak tweak designed to enhance the security of your checkm8-compatible iPhone.

Checkl0ck addresses this issue by allowing you to secure your device with a passcode and biometric authentication even after jailbreaking. It supports both numeric and alphanumeric passwords, as well as biometric unlocking via Face ID or Touch ID. Additionally, it extends its protection to third-party apps, making it a valuable addition for those who prioritize security on their jailbroken iPhones.
